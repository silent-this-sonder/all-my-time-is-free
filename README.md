# PyPlanner (WORK IN PROGRESS)
PyPlanner (working title, up for suggestions) is a to-do list, planner, and task tracking system created in Python.
It is a CLI (command line interface) and does not have a GUI, although I may create one in the future.

## Features
ummmmm, still working on this

## About
I started developing this project because I have a physical planner that I carry around.  It's been really useful, but I noticed that I repeated writing certain tasks over and over again (procrastination ._.) and I might accidentally forget them.

At around the same time, I wanted to work on coding a "serious" Python project that was actually useful to me.  Out of this, PyPlanner was born.
